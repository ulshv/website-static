So I descided to have a single source (this blog) where I can put all my posts, regardless of language or interests.</p>\n<!--\nMention here that I also wanted to make it possible to swithc easily between languages\non a single site, because articles will be interesting for both\nand I didn't want to mix their feed (in case of Medium, Instagram) in 2 different languages\n-->\n<p>After the article will be published in this blog, I‚Äôll be able to share a link to it (or make a repost) in a specific social network or platform. Also it will be possible to share articles only on those topics and languages that would be directed to a specific audience, depending on the interests of readers and platform (VK, Instagram, LinkedIn, Twitter, Habr, Medium, Hacker News, Reddit, vc.ru, LifeHacker, etc.).</p>\n<p>For example. I will probably share an article written in English with title ‚ÄúClean architecture in Web applications‚Äù on Twitter, LinkedIn and HackerNews. Tips on how to competently do tax deduction for self-employed in Russian Federation probably will be shared in VK, Habr and VC. Various lifehacks and non-technical articles could be written in both languages and shared in all platforms, depending on language.</p>\n<p>Also, not to mention the fact that on your own site you can do anything you want. Dark UI theme and filtering of articles by interests will arrive soon üòâ.</p>\n<h3>What I‚Äôll write about</h3>\n<p>I‚Äôll publish articles on a variety of topics that are interesting to me. First of all it is software developement and lifestyle but not limited on that. Also there will be articles about travel, business, finances, lifehacks, short notes on the books read, commented links to interesting articles, reports from trips, and much more!</p>","frontmatter":{"title":"Why I decided to start blogging","date":"October 07, 2019","langKey":"en","url":"why-i-decided-to-start-blogging"}}},"pageContext":{"isCreatedByStatefulCreatePages":false,"slug":"/2019/01-first-post/","translatedPost":{"node":{"fields":{"slug":"/2019/01-first-post/index_ru/","path":"/2019/01-first-post/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"–ü–æ—á–µ–º—É —è —Ä–µ—à–∏–ª –Ω–∞—á–∞—Ç—å –≤–µ—Å—Ç–∏ —Å–≤–æ–π –±–ª–æ–≥","langKey":"ru","url":"–ø–æ—á–µ–º—É-—è-—Ä–µ—à–∏–ª-–Ω–∞—á–∞—Ç—å-–≤–µ—Å—Ç–∏-—Å–≤–æ–π-–±–ª–æ–≥"}}},"previous":null,"next":null}}}
